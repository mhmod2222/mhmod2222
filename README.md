Mar.
Robotics Engineering Intern ,University of Central Florida, USA
Under supervision of Prof. Tarek Elgohary, I carried out the following: (videos here)
{Modelled a robotic mobile manipulator on ROS (RVIZ and GAZEBO) and SOLIDWORKS.
{Built the rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) planner algorithm.
{Implemented a motion planning of a mobile manipulator using python API with Moveit RRT motion
planner.
{Developed a whole body control algorithm to coordinate the motion of arm joints and mobile base wheels
simultaneously.

May.
Robotics Research Assistant ,The American University in Cairo, Egypt
I carried out the following research under the supervision of the lab director:
{Simulated two different types of electric vehicle induction motors to compare their performance.
{Identified algorithms used in automatic steering/braking used in autonomous vehicles.
{Implemented equations used to control fixed-base and mobile-base robotic manipulators as well as
techniques of controlling robotic hand to manipulate objects in a human like manner.
Projects
Self Driven Cars Specialization ,
I carried out implementation of:
{autonomous driving simulation of human driving behavior using Nvidia Net
{vehicle geometerical lateral control (pure pursuit controller - stanley controller)
{vehicle dynamical lateral control (Linear Model Preditive Control controller)
{full state estimator using ES-EKF and; fusion of imu, lidar, and gnss sensor measurements data.
Cessna aircraft flight control and dynamic modelling
{I simulated nonlinear dynamics of the aircraft using ODE45 and Runge-Kutta 4th order integrators
{And I used linearized dynamics to control attitude (pitch hold) of the aircraft
SLAM autonomous bot
{Modelled the actual bot hardware on ROS
{Interfaced ROS with arduino
{Integrated enocders, imu, and lidar sensors with gmapping particle filters slam package
Bachelor Degree Graduation Project
I made an autonomous traction control system that prevents cars from skidding and loss of traction force.
The controller doesnâ€™t depend on road parameters, and its parameters were tuned using neural networks.
